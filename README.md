To explore module federation and Micro Front end further, I have read the free version of the book named [practical module federation 2.0](https://www.scribd.com/document/612725955/Practical-Module-Federation-2-0). This is the execise project following the demo introduced by this book as a backup for a reference.

Notes and summary taken by me is here https://www.figma.com/board/Y7KUXG9wfcJ5fQr2K0bPi6/Practical-Module-Federation?node-id=0-1&t=RVHYkaNJvQtA0lpb-1, Perhaps it's helpful for a quick understanding.
