To further explore module federation and Micro Frontend development, I recently read the free version of [Practical Module Federation 2.0](https://www.scribd.com/document/612725955/Practical-Module-Federation-2-0). The book is both pragmatic and insightful, offering demos that provide valuable guidance for implementing Micro Frontends in real-world projects. I highly recommend it. This exercise project was created as a backup reference, following the demos introduced in the book.

Notes and summary taken by me is here https://www.figma.com/board/Y7KUXG9wfcJ5fQr2K0bPi6/Practical-Module-Federation?node-id=0-1&t=RVHYkaNJvQtA0lpb-1, Perhaps it's helpful for a quick understanding.
